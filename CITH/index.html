    <h2>TOTAL SUPPLY</h2>
    Just 300 CITH will ever exist — forged on Sonic, born to be legendary. No inflations, no future drops, no gimmicks. Each one is a 1/1 original with unique traits and soul. 
    <br><br>
    This is a capped cult collection, not some farm-to-table dilution play. If you're lucky enough to mint one, you're not buying art — you're joining a faction.

    <h2>BASED ARTIST</h2>
    The vision comes from an anon street surrealist with a stylus full of chaos. Every trait is hand-drawn, layered with web3 mischief, fashion sense, and cultural venom. 
    <br><br>
    No Fiverr clones or AI filters here — this is raw, gritty, dripped-in-rebellion art. Think Supreme meets Hunter S. Thompson with a PFP addiction.

<div class="info-three">
    <h2>BASED TRAITS</h2>
    These cats wear their ideology — from anti-social book hats to "legend" status headbands. Gold chains shine heavy with web3 weight, and 3D glasses decode your meme vision.
    <br><br>
    There’s cult lore behind every combo. Some traits signal prestige, others mark the wildcards. You’ll flex them, trade them, and maybe even start a turf war with them.
